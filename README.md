# Inventory-Management-System
The Inventory Management System is an application that stores "parts" and "products" and allows for manipulation of such data. New "parts" and "products" can be added, managed, and deleted using UIs which integrate text fields, search boxes, and auto-assigned IDs.

A "product" is a singular object that can be linked to a list of multiple "part" objects. An example would be a product object labelled "computer" which contains part objects such as "CPU", "RAM", and "SSD". Each object is assigned a unique ID and can be renamed. Each object contains information such as a price, stock level, minimum & maximum stock levels. The application incorporates dialog boxes to indicate erroneous data entries and confirmations on certain actions such as deleting a part.
